A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.
A class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.

When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class.
Thus, a class is a logical construct. An object has physical reality. (That is, an object occupies space in memory.)

Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.
It is useful to think of an objectâ€™s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.
